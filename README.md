Hi everyone! My name is Sunny You and I am currently enrolled at Lehigh University. I am planning on majoring in computer science because of how much my computer science teacher in high school has influenced me. I've had experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript and my most recent was Java. 

This page will contain all of my projects that I have completed for the Data Journalism class.  


# About me

I come from Philadelphia, which is about an hour away from Bethlehem. Since Philadelphia is a city, I’m not used to living around so many trees and so little cars. I’ve run a half marathon in high school but the hills on Lehigh Campus can still get very tiring for me. 

Most of the time, I really enjoy working with computers and coding has been something that I found interesting. I’ve participated in a coding competition about making a website. Specfically a website about bubbletea for a resturant chain named Mr.Wish. I was also in the robotics team in High School. I coded the robot using Java and we participated in the [First Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). We’ve won the city competition multiple times and have gone to state competitions. 


During high school, I’ve taken AP Statistics, so I have a bit of experience with data. However, writing isn’t my strong suit, so I’m looking forward to improving it. 

You can check out the website that I made [here](https://funplexer.github.io/Bubbleteam-Yum/bubbleteaintro.html), but the project was eventually dropped.

## A Look at who Gets Caught in Traffic Accidents

Road accidents are a common occurrence here in the United States and people often assume that the drivers and passengers would have injuries. But why do we automatically assume these things as if it always happens?

This infographic was created using data obtained from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2018/en/) and it shows road traffic deaths from the United States and Japan. By looking at the percentage of road deaths in the United States, we can see that 66.8% of deaths occur for persons in 4-wheel vehicles. The other types of road deaths are substantially lower in comparison. This means that people will more likely witness a road accident that results in the driver’s death than any other. As a result, people will tend to think of road injuries for drivers.

The reason that the United States has such a high percentage of 4-wheel vehicle deaths is that the U.S. has a large number of 4-wheel vehicle owners. If we compare the percentage of 4-wheel vehicle deaths between the U.S. and Japan, Japan has a lower death percentage in that area. Because of this, we can assume that Japan has safer road guidelines or that they have a lower amount of 4-wheel vehicle owners. However, the death percentage for pedestrians and cyclists is much higher in Japan than in the U.S. This means that the population tends to walk and use a bike for means of transportation. As a result, we can conclude that the number of 4-wheel vehicle owners in Japan is much lower than in the U.S. because people in Japan tend to walk or bike.

## Apple's Evolution

Apple iPhones have come a long way and will continue to evolve. The timeline below shows the evolution of Apple iPhones and their history of prices.

## Traffic Deaths Among Different Countries

![Graph](https://github.com/yousunny3/yousunny3.github.io/blob/master/Reported_Number_of_Road_Traffic_Deaths,_2016______________________________Traffic_Deaths_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

From this graph, it’s obvious that China has the most traffic deaths out of the 6 countries. What may not be obvious is why china has the most deaths. This is because one would usually think that the technology and the number of car users in the United States would be on par with China. However, since China has about 2 times more traffic deaths than the U.S., China either has more car users on the road or that the road is not particularly safe. The most likely reason is that China has a substantial amount of car users and this means that China has a higher population than the United States. This could also be applied to the other countries, where a lower number of traffic death corresponds to a lower population. In this case, in 2016, the United Kingdom would have a lower population than Canada, Canada would have a lower population than Italy, Italy would have a lower population than Japan, Japan would have a lower population than the United States and finally, the United States would have a lower population than china.
