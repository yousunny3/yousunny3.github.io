Hi everyone! My name is Sunny You and I am currently enrolled at Lehigh University. I am planning on majoring in computer science because of how much my computer science teacher in High School has influenced me. I've had experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript and my most recent was Java. 

This page will contain all of my projects that I have completed for the Data Journalism class.  


## About me

I come from Philadelphia, which is about an hour away from Bethlehem. Since Philadelphia is a city, I’m not used to living around so many trees and so little cars. I’ve run a half marathon in High School but the hills on Lehigh Campus can still get very tiring for me. 

I really enjoy working with computers and coding has been something that I found interesting. I’ve participated in a coding competition about making a website. I didn't get so far because the website was incomplete. I was also in the robotics team in High School. I coded the robot using Java and we participated in the [First Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). We’ve won the city competition multiple times and have gone to state competitions. 

I’ve taken AP Statistics in High School, so I have a bit of experience with data. However, writing isn’t my strong suit, so I’m looking forward to improving it. 

You can check out the website that I made [here](https://funplexer.github.io/Bubbleteam-Yum/bubbleteaintro.html), but remember that it's incomplete.
